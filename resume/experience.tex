{\textbf{AI Engineer}}
{\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
    \item {Over 2 years of experience in AI/ML development with a strong focus on \textbf{NLP} and \textbf{large language models (LLMs)}.}
    \item {Deployed AI/ML models into \textbf{AWS production enviroments} using \textbf{Sagemaker and Lamda}, optimizing container orchestration to reduce inference costs by \textbf{25\%} while maintaining 99.9\% availability.}
    \item {Demonstrated excellent communication and collaboration skills within cross-functional teams.}
    \item {Debugged complex systems vulenrabilities by performing meticulous code reviews and root-cause analysis, ensuring \textbf{ 99.9\% system uptime} and zero security breaches over a 12-month period.}
    \item {Developed and deployed scalable machine learning pipelines using \textbf{Python and Sckit-learn}, automating data preprocessing and feature engineering to reduce model training time by \textbf{30\%} .}
    \item {Proficiently harnessed the power of the pandas library to extract, clean and manipulate Sales data. This process involved several crucial steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information we worked with.}
    \item {Developed and consistently manage Python-based sofwtare \textbf{ Python-based sofwtare }Django and React desgined specifically for compression tasks within the swap's domain. This entails crafting efficient algorithm and processes to optimize data while adhering to industry standards.}
    \item {Additionaly, the role involves the ongoing maintenance, debugging and enhancement of the software to align with the dynamic requirements of the swaps market.}
    \item {Developed \textbf{Python scripts} that identify potential compression oppurtunities for cross-currency and inflation trades. Aiding the bank in reducing the notional value or risk exposure of financial transactions, typically derivatives or other complex instruments, by combining or netting offsetting positions.}
    \item {Contributed to the development of incremental features within the \textbf{ React framework} for the compression's platform. My role involved breaking down larger functionalities into smaller, manageable components that could be implemented iteratively. By doing so, I ensured a smooth integration of new capabilities into the existing system.}
    \item {Ideated \& implemented a development workflow for the organization using feature environments, automated testing etc. for multiple services and background jobs resulting in higher engineering productivity and faster project delivery.}
%    \item {Deployed AI/ML models into \textbf{AWS production enviroments} using \textbf{Sagemaker and Lamda}, optimizing container orchestration to reduce inference costs by \textbf{25\%} while maintaining 99.9\% availability.}
%    \item {Spearheaded the development of a domain-specific \textbf{LLM application} using \textbf{LangChain and OpenAI}, implementing \textbf{RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)} with a vector database (Pinecone) to reduce hallucination rates by \textbf{35\%} in automated customer support.}
%    \item {Tools and Technologies used: TypeScript, NodeJS, Golang, Kafka, MongoDB, Postgres, AWS, CI/CD.}
%    \item {Revamped notification service with minimal impacts, reducing peak-hour message delivery latency from \textbf{2 hours} to under \textbf{1 minute}.}
%    \item {Performed cross-functional bug bashes and refactored critical legacy modules, resulting in a \textbf{33\%} drop in on-call tickets.}
%    \item {}
%    \item {Ideated \& implemented a development workflow for the organization using feature environments, automated testing etc. for multiple services and background jobs resulting in higher engineering productivity and faster project delivery}
%    \item {\textbf{Mentored junior engineers and interns} through onboarding, code reviews, and project execution.}
%    \item {Tools and Technologies used: TypeScript, NodeJS, Golang, Kafka, MongoDB, Postgres, AWS, CI/CD.}
