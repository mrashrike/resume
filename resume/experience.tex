    \item {Develop and consistently manage Python-based software \textbf{(Flask and Angular)} designed specifically for compression tasks within the swap’s domain. This entails crafting efficient algorithms and processes to optimize data while adhering to industry standards. Additionally, the role involves the ongoing maintenance, debugging, and enhancement of the software to align with the dynamic requirements of the swaps market.}
    \item {Developed python scripts that identify potential compression opportunities for cross-currency and inflation trades. Aiding the bank in reducing the notional value or risk exposure of financial transactions, typically derivatives or other complex instruments, by combining or netting offsetting positions.}
    \item {Contributed to the development of incremental features within the Angular framework for the compression’s platform. My role involved breaking down larger functionalities into smaller, manageable components that could be implemented iteratively. By doing so, I ensured a smooth integration of new capabilities into the existing system.}
